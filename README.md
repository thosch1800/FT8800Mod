# FT8800Mod

This project is a modification to the Yaesu FT-8800, a dual VFO amateur radio transceiver. The device has a data jack that can be configured to use a particular VFO. When configured it uses this VFO for signal reception, but it is still transmitting on the main VFO. The goal of this modification is to change that behavior.

Another feature is the ability to set the frequency through a CAT-like interface (e.g. from PC or smartphone).
